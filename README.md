You can run multiple scripts in parallel just having new tabs
The Robustness has not been fully tested, and Note, it DOES NOT auto Add the class yet! It simply alerts you if its available 
The delays are quite hefty (1-5s randomized) to avoid the risk of detection, but if you feel daring quicken the time

[This is for demonstration purposes only, running this runs the risk of breaking UF's code of ethics]

enjoy!
